# Clear-and-Blur-Image-Exploration-using-Sobel-Canny-Laplacian-Method

Problem Statement : There are several PCB Images that has been given and we need to find the clearest and Blurriest image using computer vision

In this project, we decided to use Canny, Laplacian, Sobel Method to determine the clearest and the blurriest image


## Result

### Score Summary:

- **Laplacian**: Scores intensity changes, sensitive to noise.
- **Sobel**: Scores the magnitude of intensity gradients, simple and efficient.
- **Canny**: Produces binary edges indicating edge locations accurately, robust against noise.
  
The Clearest Score
